# ThreatScan — Pricing and MSP One-Pager

This document gives recommended pricing tiers and a simple ROI example for MSPs reselling or managing ThreatScan for customers.

Pricing Tiers (recommended)

- Free / Trial: 14-day full-featured trial (up to 5 targets) — $0. Useful for proof-of-value with a single customer.

- Basic MSP: $10–15 per monitored client / month
  - Core vulnerability & network scanning, weekly automated scans, email reports
  - Included: CLI + custom scheduling for each client

- Pro MSP: $25–35 per monitored client / month
  - Everything in Basic, plus predictive analytics, prioritized findings, API access, and multi-tenant dashboard
  - SLA: 24-hour response for critical issues

- Enterprise: Custom pricing (volume discounts, dedicated integrations, SSO, on-prem agent)
  - Typical bands: $20–$50 per client/mo depending on features and support level

Add-on Services

- Initial onboarding & configuration: $1,000–$5,000 (one-time) depending on number of customers and environment complexity
- Incident response retainer / emergency remediation: $200–$500 per hour, or a monthly retainer
- Managed service bundle (scanning + remediation + reporting): Custom

Example MSP ROI (simple)

- Average cost of a small breach: $50,000 (conservative estimate)
- If ThreatScan prevents one breach across an MSP's 50 customers in a year, that is $50,000 savings.
- Pro MSP pricing at $30/customer/mo across 50 customers = $30 * 50 * 12 = $18,000 annual revenue

Key positioning points for MSP sales

- Low friction: CLI-first with optional automation; fast onboarding reduces PS time and cost.
- Multi-tenant value: centralised scanning and prioritized results make it efficient to manage many clients.
- Upsell paths: Incident response, integrations (SIEM/PSA), periodic health reviews.

Billing & licensing notes

- Monthly subscription billed per-customer or per-site is recommended for predictable MRR.
- Offer a discounted annual prepaid option (e.g., 10–15% off).

Next steps for go-to-market

- Create a one-page MSP pitch deck and an SLA addendum.
- Draft cold-email sequences with a pilot offer (1–2 customers at discounted rate).
- Prepare sample bill-of-materials (SOW) for onboarding service.
